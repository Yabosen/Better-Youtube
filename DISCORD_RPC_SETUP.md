# Discord Rich Presence Setup

To use Discord Rich Presence, you need a Discord Application Client ID.

## Quick Setup (Recommended)

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Click "New Application"
3. Name it "Better YouTube" (or any name you prefer)
4. Go to "General Information"
5. Copy the "Application ID" (this is your Client ID)
6. Go to Settings > Rich Presence
7. Upload an image named "youtube" (optional, for custom icon)
8. Paste the Client ID in the Discord RPC plugin settings

## Using the Default Client ID

The app includes a default Client ID that works out of the box. You don't need to create your own unless you want custom branding.

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure Discord is running and you're logged in
- Check that your Discord status is not set to "Invisible"
- Enable "Display current activity as a status message" in Discord Settings > Activity Privacy
- Restart both Discord and Better YouTube if it's not working
